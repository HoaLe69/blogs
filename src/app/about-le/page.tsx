          I&apos;ve always been fascinated by technology --- How it works, how it evolves, and how it shapes our world.
          From my first computer programming class to diving deep into algorithms and data structures, I knew IT was the
          field for me. But beyond just the academic side, I&apos;ve always been curious about learing new tools,
          programming languages, and latest tech trends. This blog is my way of documenting and sharing what I&apos;ve
          learned, as well as helping others on their own tech journeys.
